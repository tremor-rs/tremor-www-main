    <p>
      Tremor is particularly well suited to log and metrics shipping resulting in
      10x fewer hosts, 10x fewer CPUs and 10x less memory footprint than alternatives
      such as logstash.
    </p>
    <p>
      For data distribution at scale, tremor introduces proactive rate limiting and
      back-pressure handling. These facilities mean that when systems go
      over-capacity (eg: during peak e-commerce trading environments such as cyber-5)
      - where we may already be running with scaled up infrastructure - the upstream
      or downstream resource saturation has no negative impact on our production
      operations.

    <p>
      Tremor replaces logstash, telegraf and other data distribution tools at <a

      single high performance tool that is easy to configure and use.
