The tremor project originated as an internal solution at Wayfair and has become a CNCF sandbox
project with an open community based open source development model. There are three pillars to the
governance model for tremor that are worth explicitly acknowledging.

## Governance model

The tremor project's high level governance model is designed around the requirements and best
practices of the CNCF / Linux Foundation Core Infrastructure Initiative best practice targeting
a silver badge status.

## Project model

The tremor project / product management model is designed around the linux kernel development
practices and processes.

## Community model

The tremor project has adopted the Rust community model and practices for engaging with people
and ensuring that all tremor contributors and stakeholders respect the code of conduct at all
times.
