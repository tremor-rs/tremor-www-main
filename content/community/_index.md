The Tremor project is an early stage project, with a small supporting community. As a recent
open source project we have yet to evolve our community model based on community feedback.

However, we have adopted the [Rust Community](https://www.rust-lang.org/community) as a model
for how we would like our community to evolve. To paraphrase our Rust friends "Rust's greatest
strength is the community of people who come together to make working in Rust a rewarding experience."

So, with tip of the hat to our Rust friends:


> Tremor's greatest strength is the community of people who come together to make working with Tremor a rewarding experience.

## We owe us

Now we just need to figure out which of the many wonderful community enabling tools to adopt.

## Fork now

For now, fork this web site on github or create an [issue](https://github.com/tremor-rs/tremor-www-main/issues) to get in touch while we figure out a better way!
